# INTRODUCTION

Gene expression technologies are used frequently in molecular biology
research to gain a snapshot of transcriptional activity in different
tissues or populations of cells. These profiles are then compared to
identify gene expression changes associated with a treatment condition
or phenotype of interest. Gene expression studies may be randomized
designed experiments in which a biological system is perturbed, for
example by a gene knock-out or by applying a specified stressor. Such
experiments are amongst the most powerful tools in functional genomics,
providing insights into normal cellular processes as well as disease
pathogenesis. Or they may be observational studies in which different
phenotypes are compared, diseased and normal tissue for example or cells
from different populations. Such studies are common in cancer research
and in the study of cell development. In either case, the study design
can range from simple two group comparisons to complex set-ups with
several experimental factors varying over multiple levels. Researchers
might be interested for example in whether a particular gene facilitates
or blocks the action of a particular drug, in which case knock-down and
wild-type samples both with and without drug treatment would be
profiled. Observational studies may involve multiple batch effects and
covariates that must be accounted for in the analysis.

Despite the complexity, gene expression studies often involve only a
small number of biological replicates. The small but complex nature of
gene expression studies poses challenging statistical problems and
motivates the use of a number of specialized statistical techniques in
order to get the most out of each data set. We have developed the
*limma* software over the past decade to provide a framework for
analysing gene expression experiments from beginning to end in a
flexible and statistically rigorous way.

The *limma* package is a core component of Bioconductor, an R-based
open-source software development project in statistical genomics.
It has proven a popular choice for the analysis of data from experiments
involving microarrays, high-throughput polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) (5), protein arrays and other platforms. The package is
designed in such a way that, after initial pre-processing and
normalization, the same analysis pipeline is used for data from all
technologies.

Recently, the capabilities of *limma* have expanded significantly in two
important directions. First, the package can now perform both
differential expression (DE) and differential splicing analyses of RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools
previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq
as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now
able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a
variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated
sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures.
This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of
gene expression differences.

This article reviews the philosophy and design of the *limma* package,
summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent
enhancements and features that have not been previously described. The
article outlines *limma*'s functionality at each of the main steps in a
gene expression analysis, from data import, pre-processing, quality
assessment and normalization, through to linear modelling, DE and gene
signature analyses.

Figure 3 shows example diagnostic
plots. Panel (A) shows RNA-seq data from Pickrell *et al*. (9) that has
been analysed as described by Law *et al*. (10). Panels (B) and (C)
display the two-colour microarray quality control data set presented by
Ritchie *et al*. (11). Panel (B) displays background corrected but
non-normalized intensities from one typical array. Panel (C) was
generated from a subset of 30 of the control arrays after print-tip
loess normalization.

Figure 4 shows example DE summary
plots. Panels (A) and (B) were generated using the two-colour microarray
data from GEO series
[GSE2593](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2593).
Intensities were background corrected and normalized as previously
described. Panel (A) shows a volcano plot for the comparison of
samples with RUNX1 over-expressed versus wild-type samples, while panel
(B) shows a Venn diagram of differentially expressed probes for each of
the three over-expressed genes versus wild-type. Probes with false
discovery rate less than.05 were considered to be differentially
expressed. Panel (C) uses RNA-seq data from GEO series
[GSE52870](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52870).
The data were analysed as described in Figure 5 of Liu *et al*. (7).

# RESULTS

## Statistical principles

*limma* integrates a number of statistical principles in a way that is
effective for large-scale expression studies. It operates on a matrix of
expression values, where each row represents a gene, or some other
genomic feature relevant to the current study, and each column
corresponds to an RNA sample. On the one hand, it fits a linear model to
each row of data and takes advantage of the flexibility of such models
in various ways, for example to handle complex experimental designs and
to test very flexible hypotheses. On the other hand, it leverages the
highly parallel nature of genomic data to borrow strength between the
gene-wise models, allowing for different levels of variability between
genes and between samples, and making statistical conclusions more
reliable when the number of samples is small. All the features of the
statistical models can be accessed not just for gene-wise expression
analyses but also for higher level analyses of gene expression
signatures. Figure 1 depicts the
linear model and highlights the statistical principles employed in a
typical *limma* analysis.

### Linear models analyse complete experiments together

The hallmark of the *limma* approach is the use of linear models to
analyse entire experiments as an integrated whole rather than making
piece-meal comparisons between pairs of treatments. This has the effect
of sharing information between samples. Analysing the data as a whole
also allows us to model correlations that may exist between samples due
to repeated measures or other causes. This kind of analysis would not be
feasible were the data partitioned into subsets and analysed as a series
of pairwise comparisons.

Linear models permit very general analyses. Researchers can adjust for
the effects of multiple experimental factors or can adjust for batch
effects. The linear model might include time course effects or
regression splines. The linear model could even include the expression
values themselves of one or more genes as covariates, allowing
researchers to test for inter-gene dependencies. Linear models allow
researchers to test very flexible hypotheses, not just simple
comparisons between groups but also interaction effects or more complex
customized comparisons.

### Shared global parameters link gene-wise models

A separate model is fitted for each gene, but the gene-wise models can
be linked by global parameters or global hyper-parameters. The use of
global parameters is a simple means of sharing information between genes
that can be used even for the smallest experiments, because the global
parameters can be estimated from the entire data set involving all the
genes at once. This strategy allows the gene-wise models to incorporate
such things as correlations between duplicate probes for the same gene,
or correlations between related RNA samples, or variations in quality
between the RNA samples.

### Empirical Bayes borrows information between genes

The highly parallel nature of gene expression experiments lends itself
to a particular class of statistical methods, called parametric
empirical Bayes, that borrow information between genes in a dynamic way
(14,15). The fact that the same linear model is fitted to each gene
allows us to borrow strength between genes in order to moderate the
residual variances. The estimated variance for each gene then
becomes a compromise between the gene-wise estimator, obtained from the
data for that gene alone, and the global variability across all genes,
estimated by pooling the ensemble of all genes. This has the effect of
increasing the effective degrees of freedom with which the gene-wise
variances are estimated. It was an innovation of the *limma* package to
show that exact small-sample inference could be conducted using the
empirical Bayes posterior variance estimators. This approach has
proven particularly advantageous in experiments with small sample sizes,
ensuring that inference is reliable and stable even when the number of
replicates is small.

In recent years, the empirical Bayes procedures of *limma* have been
enhanced in two important ways. First, the global variance estimate can
now incorporate a mean-variance trend. This is important
because many gene expression technologies produce data that are less
reliable at lower intensities or abundances. Second, the relative
weighting of the gene-wise and global variance estimators no longer
needs to be the same for all genes. This allows a sophisticated robust
empirical Bayes procedure in which hyper-variable genes are identified
and treated separately. Both of these enhancements improve
statistical power and accuracy by improving the modelling of the global
characteristics of the data in a more flexible way.

### Quantitative weights allow for unequal quality

Another unique feature of *limma* is the ability to incorporate
quantitative weights into all levels of the statistical analysis, from
normalization to linear modelling and gene set testing. Weights can be
applied to genes or to RNA samples or to individual expression values.
Weights can be used to give more emphasis to control probes during
normalization, or can be used to down-weight measurements or samples
that are less reliable in a gene expression analysis. The weights can be
preset based on external quality information, or may be estimated from
the expression data itself. The use of weights increases power to detect
differentially expressed genes, and having a model based approach avoids
the need for *ad hoc* decisions about which observations or samples to
filter out.

### RNA-seq and sequence data

All the downstream analysis features of *limma* are available for
RNA-seq and other sequence count data, as well as for data from
microarrays and other platforms. Traditionally, RNA-seq data require
specialized software based on the negative binomial or similar
distributions. *limma* however is able to analyse RNA-seq read
counts with high precision by converting counts to the log-scale and
estimating the mean-variance relationship empirically (Figure
3A). The mean-variance trend is
converted by the voom function into precision weights, which are
incorporated into the analysis of log-transformed RNA-seq counts using
the same linear modelling commands as for microarrays. The resulting
pipeline gives comparable performance to the best of the negative
binomial-based software packages but with greater speed and reliability
for large data sets. Additionally, and conveniently, only
minimal pipeline changes are required when switching between analyses
for RNA-seq and microarray experiments within *limma*. This also means
that the same statistical tests with the same format of results and
graphical displays are available for both data types.

### Variance models allow for unequal variability

Expression values often show some degree of heteroscedasticity, either
because there is a relationship between abundance and measurement
precision, or because some treatment conditions are more heterogeneous
than others. For example, tumours might be more variable than normal
tissue. Concern for such effects has prompted some researchers to filter
out low intensity observations or to use Welch's *t*-test for DE between
two groups instead of classical pooled *t*-tests. The use of weights and
the ability to model global parameters allow *limma* to incorporate
unequal variances in a number of ways. One way is through estimating a
mean-variance trend, which can either be incorporated into the empirical
Bayes procedure as mentioned above or used to generate observation
weights. A recent development is the ability to estimate precision
weights associated with treatment groups or more generally with any
given set of covariates. More generally again, the mean-variance trend
can be estimated in a treatment-specific way, combining the two types of
heteroscedasticity mentioned above. These approaches allow *limma* to
model unequal variances even for experiments with a small number of RNA
samples. Importantly, they accommodate unequal variances without
compromising the linear modelling and empirical Bayes framework of the
package.

### Using sets of genes to represent higher-level expression signatures

In recent years, the linear modelling capabilities of *limma* have been
extended to higher-level expression signature analyses involving
co-regulated sets of genes. The idea is to use a set of genes, together
with their log-fold-changes, to represent the transcriptional signature
of a biological process or cell type. One way that this is done is by
rotation technology, which permits statistical significance to be tested
for sets of genes for any linear model contrast. A particular
feature of rotation tests is the ability to incorporate prior
information about the direction and strength with which each gene is
expected to contribute to the statistical signature. In this way,
*limma* provides a uniquely flexible means to relate new expression data
sets to previous results collated from earlier experiments, taking into
account for example the fold-change and direction of change for each
gene in the earlier experiment.

A closely related statistical approach implemented in *limma* is to fit
global covariance models, either to estimate correlations between genes
or to estimate the relatedness between the DE profiles resulting from
difference comparisons. These new analyses are described briefly later
in this article.

### Pre-processing methods preserve information

Microarray expression data are measured as intensities, which need to be
background corrected and normalized before any statistical analysis can
be conducted. *limma* includes a range of background correction and
normalization procedures suitable for different types of DNA microarrays
or protein arrays. Notable are the maximum likelihood implementation of
the normal-exponential convolution model for background correction
and the implementation of loess curves and normalization using
quantitative weights. The guiding principle in the pre-processing steps
is to preserve information, avoiding missing values or inflated
variances. Normalized intensities are offset from zero before
transforming to the log-scale to avoid missing values or large
variances. Offsets in a range of moderate values have been shown to
achieve an effective compromise between noise and bias.

### Mean-difference plots

Measuring expression in multiple RNA samples produces columns of
correlated expression values, which are highly correlated because they
are measured on the same set of genes or genomic features. It has long
been established in the biomedical literature that the level of
agreement between correlated variables can be usefully examined by
plotting differences versus means. Such a plot is called a Bland–Altman
plot or a Tukey mean-difference plot. Indeed the concept of DE
can be viewed as a measure of disagreement between expression measures
for the same genes in different samples. Mean-difference plots were
introduced to the two-colour microarray literature by Dudoit *et al*.
(27) and to the single-channel literature by Bolstad *et al*. (28), who
called them MA-plots. *limma* generalized the concept of an MA-plot in
two ways. First, the idea was extended to apply to sets of
single-channel expression values. In this case, the plot is used to
compare each sample to the average of all other samples. A virtual array
is constructed by averaging the log-expression value for all the samples
other than the sample of interest, and then a mean-difference plot is
made between the single array and the virtual array. Second, the idea
was extended to apply to the fitted model objects. In this case, the
plot compares the log-fold-changes for a chosen contrast versus the
average log-expression values of each gene across all samples. In
effect, this plots a coefficient of the linear model versus an overall
mean intercept parameter. These ideas were part of the original *limma*
package submitted to Bioconductor in 2003.

### Parametric modelling versus permutation methods

It is worth mentioning what *limma* does not do, which is permutation or
re-sampling-based inference. Permutation is frequently useful in
large-scale studies when the aim is to compare two groups. However
permutation has a number of disadvantages that make it unattractive for
assessing DE in experiments with complex designs. If permutation is
applied only to samples involved in two treatment conditions to be
compared, then the typically small number of replicates is a severe
limitation that will result in low power to detect differences. If
permutation is applied to all the samples in a multi-factor experiment,
then the composite null hypothesis being testing is an uninteresting one
and the power to reject it may be highly dependent on the existence of
DE between treatment conditions that are not of primary interest. In
other words, permutation cannot be tuned to test specific null
hypotheses of interest in a designed experiment. Even more importantly,
permutation assumes that all samples are independent and identically
distributed under the null hypothesis, and these assumptions are
frequently, usually perhaps, unrealistic. In addition, permutation is
potentially misleading when the samples are correlated or of unequal
precision. In other words, permutation is unable to accommodate blocking
structures or quality weights. In small, complex experiments, the
potential compromises involved in modelling expression values using
parametric distributions, which can never be perfectly correct, are
outweighed by the gains in precision and accuracy by modelling the
variance structure more realistically.

## Pre-processing RNA-seq and other sequencing data

Figure 2 provides an overview of
the functions available at each stage of a gene expression analysis. The
first step is to import expression data into the R session.

*limma* accepts RNA-seq data in the form of a matrix of read counts,
with rows for genomic features and columns for RNA samples.
Alternatively it can accept a DGEList object from the *edgeR* package.
The genomic regions are often genes or exons, but could in principle be
any genomic feature of interest. In this article, the regions will
usually be called genes for simplicity of terminology. The read counts
are processed by the voom function in *limma* to convert them into
log_{2} counts per million (logCPM) with associated precision
weights. The logCPM values can be normalized between samples by the voom
function or can be pre-normalized by adding normalization factors within
*edgeR*.

Raw read counts are assembled outside *limma* using tools such as
featureCounts, HTSeq-counts or RSEM. The authors of this
article find the Subread and featureCounts pipeline particularly
convenient because it is fast, accurate and can be run from the R
prompt using the *Rsubread* package. The data input to *limma* should be
counts, rather than popular expression summaries such as
reads-per-kilobase-per-million (RPKM), so that *limma* can estimate the
appropriate mean-variance relationship. The voom output can be converted
to RPKM values for convenience of interpretation, by subtracting
log-gene-lengths, but this should be done after running voom rather than
before.

After running voom, downstream analysis for RNA-seq data is the same as
for any other technology. For example, RNA-seq data can be explored
using boxplots or mean-difference plots, similarly to single-channel
microarray data. More detail about this is given in the following
sections.

## Preprocessing microarray data

### Reading or importing data

For DNA or protein microarrays, importing expression data often involves
reading output files created by an image analysis program.
Alternatively, a data frame of expression values may be read from a file
or data might be directly imported as an R object.

The main *limma* function to read image output files is read.maimages.
This function directly supports formats written by many different image
analysis programs including GenePix, Agilent Feature Extraction,
ArrayVision, BlueFuse, ImaGene, QuantArray and SPOT (Table
1). It also supports the
Stanford Microarray Database format. Output in other formats can be read
if the appropriate column names are supplied. Two-colour and
single-channel data are both supported. Illumina BeadChips need special
treatment: output from Illumina's GenomeStudio can be read by read.ilmn
if exported as a text file or by read.idat if in binary format.

###### Standard microarray data formats handled by *limma*

| Software | Vendor | Channels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agilent Feature Extraction | Agilent Technologies | 1/2 |
| ArrayVision | GE Healthcare | 1/2 |
| BlueFuse | BlueGnome | 1/2 |
| GenePix | Molecular Devices | 1/2 |
| BeadScan/GenomeStudio | Illumina Inc. | 1 |
| ImaGene | BioDiscovery | 1/2 |
| QuantArray | PerkinElmer Life Sciences | 1/2 |
| ScanArray Express | PerkinElmer Life Sciences | 1/2 |
| SMD | Stanford | 1/2 |
| Spot | CSIRO | 1/2 |

Data output by the above software can be read-in using read.maimages or
read.ilmn. limma can read files in other formats, provided the user
provides the names of the columns containing foreground and background
intensities.

Probe annotation is read automatically if contained in the image output
files, or can be read separately and added to the data object. readGAL
supports the GenePix Gene Array List format. read.maimages includes the
ability to generate spot quality weights according to any user-specified
rule based on any information found in the image output files.

*limma* includes many possibilities for using or highlighting different
types of control probes. The functions readSpotTypes and controlStatus
are provided to conveniently classify probes based on text found in the
input files. The status of each probe is automatically carried through
to appropriate downstream functions.

The function readTargets is provided to read information about the RNA
samples or *targets*. This information typically includes information
about the treatment conditions and experimental design.

*limma* can accept data objects containing expression data from other
Bioconductor packages. It can accept marrayNorm objects from the
*marray* package, PLMset objects from the *affyPLM* package, vsn objects
from the *vsn* package or objects of any class inheriting from
ExpressionSet. Alternatively, expression data can be supplied as a
numeric matrix. Expression values can be image intensities or normalized
log-expression values.

### Background correction

When array images are read, it is usual to read both foreground and
background intensities for each probe. The background intensities can be
used to derive an estimate of the ambient intensity affecting each
probe. Removing this non-specific signal from the foreground intensity
of each probe is called background correction and it is typically the
first step in processing microarray images. Simply subtracting
background from foreground intensities is too heavy-handed. The
*limma* backgroundCorrect function offers a range of more sophisticated
alternatives, most unique to the package. These include a method based
on a convolution of normal distributions and a normal-exponential
(*normexp*) convolution with different options for parameter
estimation. The plotFB function plots foreground against background
intensities for each array and is useful for choosing an appropriate
correction method.

Illumina arrays again benefit from special treatment. The nec function
implements normexp background correction for Illumina BeadChips making
special use of the control probes that are specific to these arrays
(24).

The propexpr function compares intensities to those of negative control
probes to estimate the total proportion of probes on each array that
correspond to expressed genes. This provides an estimate of the
size of the transcriptome in each sample and is useful for deciding how
many probes to filter from downstream analyses.

### Normalization

Before meaningful comparisons can be made between treatment conditions
in a designed experiment, it is critical that the expression values are
normalized so that all the samples are as far as possible on the same
measurement scale. The purpose of normalization is to remove systematic
effects due to technical differences between the assays unassociated
with the biological differences of interest. Different technology
platforms introduce different biases and so require different
normalization methods. The normalizeWithinArrays function normalizes
data from two-colour microarrays by aligning the two channels for each
array. A popular method is to remove intensity-dependent dye-biases and
spatial artefacts from *M*-values (log-intensity ratios) using locally
weighted regression (loess) (35). The normalizeBetweenArrays function
aligns expression values between samples for one-colour microarrays and
other single channel platforms using methods such as quantile
normalization or cyclic loess. Both functions provide a range of
different normalization methods suitable for different platforms.
normalizeBetweenArrays also implements separate channel normalization
methods for two-colour arrays. *limma* is the only software to
allow the use of quantitative weights in loess normalization,
giving it the ability to downweigh less reliable probes or to give
higher priority to control probes or house-keeping genes. The latter
ability has been exploited for normalizing assays when the proportion of
differentially expressed genes may be high, for example boutique arrays
(39), miRNA arrays, PCR arrays, protein arrays or protein mass
spectrometry. Other enhancements include the ability to replace the
loess curve with a spline curve that has high robustness breakdown
properties, and the ability to apply empirical Bayes moderation to the
spline curves for multiple regions within the same array (robust-spline
normalization).

The neqc function implements quantile normalization for Illumina
BeadChips making special use of the control probes specific to these
arrays.

All the between-arrays normalization methods are accessible for RNA-seq
data from within the voom function. Alternatively, voom has the ability
to respect normalization factors computed outside of *limma* by methods
such as trimmed mean of *M*-values or conditional quantile
normalization.

## Graphical exploration of data quality

Diagnostic plots allow the user to visually inspect data from a designed
experiment in order to identify potential quality problems, such as
degraded samples, or problems that arise due to array handling or sample
processing. Such displays may also reveal systematic biases that should
be removed prior to downstream analysis. Figure
3 presents examples from three
different plotting functions.

Plots for individual arrays include the foreground–background plots
mentioned above (plotFG), image plots that can reveal inconsistencies
across the array surface (

imageplot) and mean-difference plots that show intensity-dependent
trends in the log-ratios of two-colour arrays (plotMA, Figure
3B). The plotMA function can show
similar plots for single channel data. In this case, the mean-difference
plot is constructed by comparing the log-expression values for that
sample compared with the mean of all other samples. The plotMA function
makes it simple to highlight particular subsets of probes or genes, for
example control probes. Control probes are automatically highlighted if
they have previously been identified using controlStatus (Figure
3B).

The distribution of expression values can be compared between samples
using box plots or density plots (plotDensities). The latter is
particularly useful when considering separate channel analyses of
two-colour arrays.

## Finding differentially expressed genes

### Exploration of sample relationships

After the pre-processing steps described above, the next major analysis
stage is to identify differentially expressed genes. It is advisable to
begin the DE analysis with a plot that visualizes the relative
differences in transcriptional profile between the samples. The plotMDS
function uses multi-dimensional scaling to plot differences in
expression profiles between different samples (Figure
3C). Distances between samples on
the plot represent ‘leading fold change’, which is defined as the
root-mean-square average of the log-fold-changes for the genes best
distinguishing each pair of samples. This provides a type of
unsupervised clustering of the samples. It is useful for examining how
different are the profiles produced by different experimental factors
and for identifying unexpected patterns, such as batch effects, that
should be adjusted for during the linear model analysis. This helps
guide the construction of the design matrix used for the linear
modelling below.

The plotRLDF function provides a supervised plot of the samples that
shows whether the expression data can distinguish a set of known groups.
The function implements a regularized version of linear discriminant
functions.

The removeBatchEffect function can be used to remove systematic
variation due to batches or other covariates prior to plotting the data
so that the effect of treatments can be better seen.

### Linear modelling

The core component of the *limma* package is the ability to fit
gene-wise linear models to gene expression data in order to assess DE
(16). The basic idea is to estimate log-ratios (for two-channel data) or
log-intensities (for single-channel data) between two or more target RNA
samples simultaneously.

Each analysis begins with a matrix of expression levels, with
probes/genes/exons in the rows and different samples
(biological/technical replicates) in the columns. The linear modelling
is performed in a row-wise fashion, with regression coefficients and
standard errors either directly estimating the comparisons of interest
or via contrasts. Test-statistics are obtained for gene ranking that can
be further summarized at the gene set level to perform gene
signature/pathway-level ranking.

The flexibility of the linear modelling approach allows almost any
experimental design to be handled. Experiments with two or more groups,
factorial and time-course designs, and internal controls such as
dye-swaps can all be modelled and summarized using the lmFit function.
Where appropriate, nuisance variables such as batch and dye effects can
also be modelled. Models can be fit robustly or by least squares. Once a
linear model is fitted, the makeContrasts function can be used to form a
contrast matrix. The fitted model object and contrast matrix are used by
contrasts.fit to compute log_{2}-fold-changes and *t*-statistics
for the contrasts of interest. This allows all possible pairwise
comparisons between treatments to be made.

The plotSA function provides a useful diagnostic plot of the linear
model fit, plotting gene-wise residual standard deviations against
average log-expression. This allows mean-variance trends to be readily
identified, should they exist.

### Quality weights and heteroscedasticity

*limma* is the only package that allows variations in quality to be
handled in a graduated way via quantitative weights. Both
observation-level and sample-specific weights can be used
in an analysis. For microarray data, the arrayWeights function estimates
relative array variances, which are converted to weights that can be
used in the linear model analysis to down-weight observations from less
reliable arrays. Probe and array weights can be easily combined by
multiplying them together and, when used appropriately, have been
demonstrated to increase power to detect DE.

For RNA-seq data, the voomWithQualityWeights function combines
observation-level and sample-specific weights for use in the subsequent
linear modelling.

### Blocking and random effects

*limma* includes a unique strategy for incorporating the fact that
observations or samples may be correlated. The strategy is similar to
fitting a random effects model, with the difference that all genes are
constrained to share the same intrablock correlation. The
duplicateCorrelation function is used to estimate the consensus
correlation. The correlation structure is then incorporated into the
linear model fit and hence into all tests for DE. Originally the idea
was used to estimate the correlation between replicate copies of the
same probe on a microarray. The correlation strategy preserves more
information than simply averaging the replicate probe copies. More
generally, the same idea is also used to model the correlation between
related RNA samples, for example repeated measures on the same
individual or RNA samples collected at the same time.

### Separate channel analysis of two-colour microarrays

Two-colour microarrays are traditionally analysed in terms of log-ratios
between the two channels hybridized to each probe. *limma* also provides
the possibility of analysing two-colour microarrays as if they were
single channel microarrays with two separate samples hybridized to each
physical array. This provides a very powerful type of analysis in which
intensities can be directly compared between microarrays. The pairing of
the red and green channels from each array is kept track of by
estimating the correlation between the two channels hybridized to each
probe. This type of separate channel analysis uses the
intraspotCorrelation and lmscFit functions.

All the linear model fits, whether using lmFit or lmscFit, produce a
fitted model object with the same structure. The same fitted model
applies regardless of whether correlations have been estimated, whether
robust regression or least squares has been used, or whether quality
weights have been included. This consistency allows the same framework
for DE to be used for all experimental designs and platform
technologies.

### Testing for DE

An empirical Bayes framework to borrow information between genes when
estimating the variances is implemented in the eBayes function.
Gene-wise variances are squeezed towards the common or trended variance,
which reduces the number of false positives for genes with very small
variances and improves power to detect DE for genes with larger
variances. *limma* includes a robustified shrinkage strategy that allows
for gene-wise shrinkage factors to be estimated. This ensures
unusually large variances are not squeezed too heavily, reducing the
chance that they will appear statistically significant, while more
consistently expressed genes are squeezed more severely towards the
common variance. This robust strategy offers the benefits of shrinkage
to the majority of the genes, whilst negating the effects of outliers.

For each coefficient in the linear model or contrast, empirical Bayes
moderated *t*-statistics and their associated *P*-values are generally
used to assess the significance of the observed expression changes.
*T*-statistics can also be translated into Bayesian log-odds of DE.
Moderated *F*-statistics that combine the *t*-statistics for all
contrasts into an overall test of significance for each gene can also be
used.

When one has a particular cut-off for log-fold-change in mind, the treat
function can be used to test whether the log_{2}-fold-change is
greater than a threshold rather than merely different to zero. This
can be effective for prioritizing results that are biologically as well
as statistically significant.

*limma* provides a number of options to adjust tests for multiple
testing. Users can control either the family-wise type I error rate or
the false discovery rate. As well as the usual control for multiple
testing across multiple genes, *limma* is the only software package to
provide methods for error rate control across multiple contrasts and
genes simultaneously. For individual tests, multiple testing can be
applied using the topTable function. The decideTests function gives
access to the full range of options.

To visualize the results of a DE analysis for single or multiple
contrasts, *limma* provides a number of plotting options. Figure
4 shows three such displays: a
volcano plot showing the DE results from a single condition, a Venn
diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes in multiple
experimental conditions and a barcode enrichment plot highlighting a
particular gene signature in a DE analysis ranked by moderated
*t*-statistics.

Another useful plot is produced by plotMA, which plots estimated
log-fold-changes against mean log-expression for each gene. This allows
the magnitude of changes to be visualized in the context of overall
expression level; see for example Figure 5C of Liu *et al*. (7).

### Testing for differential splicing

The linear model framework of *limma* is extended to test very easily
for differential splicing events when exon-level expression data are
available. The data can be either from an exon microarray or from
RNA-seq data summarized at the exon level. In either case, the approach
is based on fitting linear models to the exon-level expression data. The
approach can relate differential exon usage to continuous as well as
categorical predictors or to any contrast in a linear model. The test is
conducted by the diffSplice function and results are displayed using
plotSplice and topSplice. The plotExons function is also useful for
exploring exon expression for individual genes. This approach is
considerably faster than alternative approaches to differential
splicing, making large-scale surveys of differential exon usage
feasible.

## Higher-level analyses

Linear modelling of gene expression data provides the ideal platform
from which to attack larger functional genomic questions related to
gene-wise independence or interaction and the decomposition of gene
signatures into distinct molecular pathways. This section describes
higher-level analyses involving multiple genes.

### Estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses

First we consider DE from a genomic point of view. The DE analyses
described so far identify individual differentially expressed genes
according to an FDR criterion. However, for most studies, there are
likely to be false negatives: truly differentially expressed genes that
are not detected as differentially expressed because the study did not
have enough statistical power to identify them with confidence.

The propTrueNull function estimates the number of truly differentially
expressed genes that remain to be identified. Mathematically, it
estimates the proportion of true null hypotheses in a collection of
hypothesis tests given a vector of *P*-values. In a gene expression
study, it estimates the proportion of non-differentially expressed
genes, out of all tested, for any contrast in the linear model. The
function implements a number of different methods for estimating the
proportion of true nulls, ranging from quick and simple to more
computationally demanding. The default is based on averaging local false
discovery rates across the *P*-values. Other methods are the
histogram method of, the convex decreasing density estimate of
(50) and a very simple estimate based on averaging the *P*-values.

### Genuine association of gene expression profiles

Gene expression experiments typically involve a number of different
treatment conditions. A question that often arises is this: to what
extent do two different treatments produce similar or different
expression profiles? One way to address this question is to count the
overlap in differentially expressed genes from the two treatments, as in
sensitive to the significance cut-off used to identify differentially
expressed genes, has little chance of success in situations where power
to detect differentially expressed genes is relatively low and is
subject to technical biases when both treatments are compared back to
the same control samples. The genas function addresses these
problems. It tests whether two different contrasts in a linear model
affect the same genes in similar or different ways, adjusting for
biases, without needing to apply a significance cut-off for assessing
DE. More technically, it estimates the true biological correlation
between the log_{2}-fold-changes of two different contrasts. By
biological correlation, we mean the correlation that would exist between
log-fold-changes if they could be measured perfectly without any
statistical error. genas is based on a bivariate generalization of the
empirical Bayes model that is used to assess DE in *limma*. This method
is particularly powerful for gaining insight into commonly affected gene
pathways when the changes are small but consistent. For instance,
applying genas to a microarray study looking at the relationship between
polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 1 and PRC2 facilitated the discovery of
the opposing roles of these two complexes. This relationship would
have been missed if the analysis had been restricted to the
statistically significant genes from each contrast alone.

### Gene set testing

Gene set analyses assess the overall significance of a set of
co-regulated genes. Each gene set is chosen to represent a particular
molecular pathway or some other biological process of interest. Gene
sets are defined by gene annotation external to the current expression
study, for example from Gene Ontology (GO) database or from
previous expression studies. For gene sets defined by previous studies,
the genes may optionally be annotated with the direction and magnitude
of expression changes in the earlier experiment. In this way, a gene set
may contain genes both positively and negatively associated with the
molecular pathway that it represents.

*limma* contains a range of options for gene set testing via the goana,
geneSetTest, camera, roast and romer functions. The goana function
provides a traditional GO overlap analysis but with the added ability to
adjust for gene length or abundance biases in RNA-seq DE detection.
goana uses generalized hypergeometric tests to test for enrichment of GO
terms in the list of differentially expressed genes. It operates
directly on the fitted model object and extracts differentially
expressed genes automatically.

Unlike goana, the other gene set options do not require a significance
threshold to be applied to identify differentially expressed genes. The
simplest approach is implemented in the geneSetTest and wilcoxGST
functions, which perform rank-based tests. These tests assess
whether the specified set of genes is more highly ranked in an ordered
list of all genes than would be expected by chance. These tests have
been found to give an effective ranking of biologically significant
pathways, but they implicitly assume that the expression level of
each gene is conditionally independent of other genes and hence give
optimistic *P*-values.

More sophisticated competitive tests that take into account dependence
between the genes in the linear modelling framework are implemented in
the camera function. Camera computes a variance inflation factor
from the inter-gene correlation and uses this to adjust the variance of
the summary statistics. This avoids optimistic *P*-values in the test
results, but also reduces statistical power. Camera has been used
successfully in a number of biomedical projects.

The roast and mroast functions implement a self-contained test of
whether any worthwhile subset of the specified set of genes is
differentially expressed. These functions use rotation tests, a
specialized simulation technique for multivariate normal models.
Rotation can be viewed as a smoothed version of permutation that is
suitable for linear models. Rotation occurs only in the residual space
of the linear model in such a way that any coefficients in the linear
model other than the contrast being tested are held constant.
Roast can provide good statistical power in small complex gene
expression experiments. Of all gene set tests, roast has the unique
ability to take into account directional annotation information about
genes in the set. It is able to accommodate genes both positively and
negatively associated with a specified pathway, as well as the magnitude
of change of each gene. It is therefore especially useful for finding
similarities in gene expression patterns between different expression
studies (Figure 4C).
Other potential applications for roast include those where the set might
not be made up of genes, for example exon-level expression analyses to
test whether any exon of a given gene is differentially expressed.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an approach that correlates a
large database of co-regulated gene sets with respect to a microarray or
RNA-seq data set. GSEA is a hybrid approach: it is competitive
in that different sets are pitted against one another, but significance
is evaluated by permutation of sample labels. The romer function in
*limma* implements a GSEA approach that is based on rotation instead of
permutation. Like camera and mroast, it can be used with a battery of
gene sets and with any linear model. The *limma* authors maintain mouse
and human versions of the Molecular Signatures Database collections
in R binary format that can be conveniently used with camera, mroast or
romer (<http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB>).

The use of gene sets require that gene symbols and annotation be matched
between different databases and studies. Gene symbols change over time,
so *limma* includes the alias2Symbol and alias2SymbolTable functions to
map gene symbol aliases to current official gene symbols. The id2indices
function matches gene identifiers in a collection of gene sets to those
in the expression matrix, in a format suitable for input into camera,
mroast or romer.

A gene set test can be visualized using the barcodeplot function (Figure
4C). Genes are ranked according to
their DE results in the current study, then genes from the *a priori*
set are highlighted by vertical bars, with a smoother line showing the
relative enrichment of the gene set amongst high and low ranked genes.
Barcodeplot is similar to the set location plot introduced by
Subramanian *et al*. (63), with a number of enhancements, especially the
ability to incorporate genes with positive and negative prior
directions. Barcodeplot can optionally display varying weights for
different genes, for example log-fold-changes from a previous
experiment.

## User-interface

### Object-oriented programming

A simple but appropriate object-oriented paradigm provides users with a
consistent analysis interface that is very easy from a user point of
view. Many *limma* functions are generic or operate appropriately on
objects of different classes. *limma* defines a number of classes that
have been tailored to handle both microarray and RNA-seq data. The
philosophy has been to define simple list-based data objects that can be
easily explored and manipulated by users, in the same style as familiar,
long-standing core functions in R such as lm and glm.

For raw intensity data, the classes ‘RGList’ and ‘EListRaw’ are used to
store two-colour and single-channel data, respectively. These objects
are often created using the function read.maimages and contain the raw
values from the image analysis output files along with probe annotation
information.

Normalized data are stored in ‘MAList’ or ‘EList’ objects. Normalized
two-colour data are converted from red and green intensities, *R* and
*G*, into *M* and *A*-values, which hold the log-ratio and average
log-intensity values for each spot. Single channel data are background
corrected and log_{2} transformed and stored in an ‘EList’
object. For RNA-seq data, the voom transformed matrix of gene/exon
counts is also stored in an ‘EList’ object.

The next major classes store output from a DE analysis. ‘MArrayLM’
objects store the result of fitting gene-wise linear models to the
normalized intensities or log-ratios. Objects of this class are created
by the lmFit and eBayes functions. After running decideTests, an object
of class ‘TestResults’ stores the results of testing a set of contrasts
equal to zero for each probe/gene.

All of these data classes obey many analogies with matrices. In the case
of ‘RGList’, ‘MAList’, ‘EListRaw’ and ‘EList’, rows correspond to
probes/genes and columns to different samples. In the case of ‘MarrayLM’
and ‘TestResults’ rows correspond to unique probes/genes and the columns
to linear model coefficients or contrasts. The standard R functions
summary, dim, length, ncol, nrow, dimnames, rownames, colnames have
methods for each of these classes. Objects of any of these classes may
also be subsetted. Multiple data objects may be combined by rows to add
extra probes, or by columns to add extra arrays.

Furthermore all of these classes may be coerced to be of class matrix
using as.matrix, although this entails loss of information. Fitted model
objects of class ‘MArrayLM’ can be coerced to class data.frame using
as.data.frame in R. The first five classes belong to the virtual class
‘LargeDataObject’ for which a show method is defined to display the
leading rows of a large vector, matrix or data.frame.

### Computational efficiency

The *limma* package is implemented primarily in R and includes some
C code to speed up computationally intensive steps. At every stage,
effort has been expended to achieve high numerical reliability and
efficiency. The memory requirements are linear in the number of genes
and the number of samples. Most estimation procedures finish in a few
seconds on a standard desktop computer and virtually all in less than a
minute.

### Availability

The *limma* software is freely available online as part of the
Bioconductor project (<http://www.bioconductor.org>). More than 120
other Bioconductor packages make use of *limma* (as of March 2014). The
*limma* package is used as a building block or as the underlying
computational engine by a number of software projects designed to
provide user-interfaces for gene expression data analysis including
*limmaGUI* (66), *affylmGUI* (67), WebArray, RACE, CarmaWEB
(70), Goulphar, MAGMA, Asterias, GenePattern, GEO2R
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r>), the EBI expression atlas
(75), Guide and Degust (<http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/degust>).

### Documentation

The *limma* package provides three levels of documentation. First, each
function has its own documentation page that concisely but completely
specifies the input data, options and output format of the function.
Similarly, each data class has a documentation page explaining all the
required and optional components of objects of that class. Care is taken
to adhere to the same standards and style that users will be familiar
with from help pages in the base R packages.

Second, a series of more general subject help pages serve to link
together functions and classes that are used for related purposes. The
subject pages cover the topics of (i) introduction, (ii) classes, (iii)
reading data, (iv) background correction, (v) normalization, (vi) linear
models, (vii) individual channel analysis of two-colour data, (viii)
hypothesis testing for linear models, (ix) diagnostics and quality
assessment, (x) gene set tests and (xi) RNA-seq.

Third, the package comes with an extensive user's guide of over 120
pages, available from the drop-down menu in Windows or alternatively
launched by the limmaUsersGuide command. The user's guide gives detailed
advice on how to analyse a variety of common study designs. It also
includes 10 fully worked case studies for which full data and code are
provided.

Users who need more help or advice are invited to post questions to the
Bioconductor support site (<https://support.bioconductor.org>).
Questions are usually answered promptly, either by the authors or by
other members of the Bioconductor community. The support site archives
answers to many common questions, including many queries about
experimental design and setting up appropriate design matrices.

# DISCUSSION

This article has summarized the current features of the widely used,
open source *limma* package for gene expression analysis. This software
provides an integrated data analysis solution, using advanced
computational algorithms to deliver reliable performance on large data
sets and object-oriented ideas to represent expression data and simplify
the user interface. New functionality is continually being added as
model refinements and new use cases arise.

Although originally developed with microarray data in mind, the
development of the voom methodology unlocks the majority of analysis
methods for use on RNA-seq data, such as random effects modelling and
gene set testing. As with any data analysis problem, the appropriate
combination of methods to use will depend upon the biological question,
platform used (microarray/RNA-seq) and experimental design.

Being R-based, reports of *limma* analyses can be compiled using Sweave
(77) or *knitr* (78) and provided along with the raw data in a
compendium to promote reproducible research in genomics.

Applications of *limma*'s linear modelling strategy beyond the intended
analysis of gene expression data have been made in a variety of
applications, including the analysis of data from Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance spectroscopy, PCR (including Nanostring), quantitative
proteomics, DNA methylation arrays and comparative ChIP-seq.

As the cost of collecting genome-wide profiles continues to fall, we
expect the popularity of this approach to continue to grow, with new
applications in the analysis of single cell gene expression data,
CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens and methylation analysis.
